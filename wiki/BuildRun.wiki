# Build and Run - page describes the build and run processes.  Building the kernel using the cross compiler and running bochs with the resulting floppy image.  

= Build =

Building the kernel is outlined [http://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_bones here].  You can build by running the build script in the src directory.  The build script will create a kernel.bin, the compiled kernel binary, and floppy.img, the binary file which contains the kernel, loader, and GRUB needed for bochs to load the kernel into memory.

= Run =
Execute the run script in the src directory.  This will start up Bochs and tell it where the floppy image is that contains the bootup image.
